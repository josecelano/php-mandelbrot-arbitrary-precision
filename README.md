# Mandelbrot Kata

This a little programming exercise using the fractal domain, in particular the Mandelbrot Set.

Detailed explanations about the Mandelbrot Set can be found here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set

The goals of the kata are:

* Understand a little bit the mathematical concepts behind fractals.
* Apply Test-First Programming approach.
* Improve OO programming skills.

In order to finish the kata you have to draw two versions of the Mandelbrot fractal:

* ASCII graph: see file `mandelbrot-160x160.txt`
* Image (background white and mandelbrot set in black): see file `mandelbrot-160x160.png`

### Math

Basically, there is a mathematical formula for complex number:

```
f(x) = zÂ² + c
```

where `z` and `c` are complex number. 

The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers `c` for which the function does not diverge when iterated from z=0.
Than means, given a `c` complex number, if you apply the formula to that number `n` times using the previous result as the new `z` number, that `c` belongs to Mandelbrot Set if the sequence does not diverge.

You can represent those complex number in a graph where x-axis is the real part of the complex number and y-axis is the imaginary part.

### Drawing the fractal

You have to draw the portion of the graph between -2 and 2 real and imaginary parts.
Mandelbrot Set is inside those limits.

### Prerequisites

PHP
```
PHP 7.4
```

### Installation

PHP without docker
```
composer install
```

PHP with docker
```
docker build -t php-mandelbrot .
docker run -it --rm \
	-v "$PWD":/usr/src/app \
	-w /usr/src/app \
	-u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
	php-mandelbrot \
    composer install
```

## Running the tests

PHP without docker
```
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

PHP with docker
```
docker run -it --rm \
	-v "$PWD":/usr/src/app \
	-w /usr/src/app \
	-u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
	php-mandelbrot
```

Execute only one test class
```
docker run -it --rm \
	-v "$PWD":/usr/src/app \
	-w /usr/src/app \

## Performance

It's very bad. It's not the goal of the project.

For 8192px image:
* Size: 8192x8192px
* Iter: 200
* Decimal precision: 28
* Time: 179m (2,98h)
* Performance: 0,17ms/px
* Min number step: 0,00048828125 (4/8192)

For 16384px image:
* Size: 16384x16384px
* Iter: 200
* Decimal precision: 28
* Time: 673m (11,21h)
* Performance: 0,17ms/px
* Min number step: 0,000244140625 (4/16384)

## TODO

Increase performance:
* Use [PHP parallel](https://www.php.net/manual/en/parallel.setup.php	)
* Symmetry real axis.
* Mapping from pixel to complex number only for one image corner. Calculate next pixel complex from previous complex number.

More fun:
* Auto zoom.
* Build only the image for a tile.
* Add color map (grey scale).

Arbitrary precision:
* Test it with numbers greater than PHP float precision.
